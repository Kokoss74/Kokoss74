Hello! I'm **Pasha Feldman** 👋

I am a **Proactive Full Stack Developer** with proven experience working in dynamic startup environments 🚀. My core stack includes **React/TypeScript** and related modern frameworks (Redux, Zustand, Tailwind) on the frontend, **Node.js** and **Java** on the backend, robust knowledge of **databases** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase), and practical experience with **cloud infrastructure** (AWS, DigitalOcean).

My special passion and focus is on **strategic AI/LLM integration** into the development process. I firmly believe that modern AI tools are a **'force multiplier'** for developers. 💡 They empower a single engineer to achieve productivity and solve problems previously requiring an entire team. I leverage cutting-edge tools (like Claude, Roo Code) to accelerate development, improve code quality, and build innovative solutions, acting as the architect leading my 'personal development team' of AI tools. 🤖✨

I am always results-oriented, quickly master new tools, excel at collaborating within cross-functional teams, and am eager to apply my experience to translate business needs into impactful technical solutions.

Here are a few more things about me:

🔭 I’m currently working on: Architecting and deploying custom **AI-Driven Assistants** using LLM integrations and a proprietary framework at **Botnexus**, expanding the client portfolio.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Exploring advanced techniques for **AI-powered code generation**, prompt engineering, process optimization, and experimenting with the latest **LLM models** to stay at the cutting edge of AI-enhanced development.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Interesting projects involving **AI integration in Full Stack development**, building innovative **SaaS solutions**, or contributing to **Open Source** where I can leverage my skills and learn from others.

💬 Ask me about: My experience with **React/TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **AWS**, **Supabase**, designing **scalable systems**, implementing **microservices**, and, of course, how to **effectively use AI tools in your daily development workflow**!
